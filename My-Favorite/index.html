    <h4>

    <h2>Basketball</h2>
    <h4>
      Basketball is probably my favorite sport. I always enjoy playing and
      watching basketball. My favorite team is the Portland Trailblazers. The
      start player Damian Lillard is my inspiration. He is the reason I started
      playing basketball.

    <h2>Man Like Mobeen</h2>
    <h4>
      Man Like Mobeen is an excellent show. The reason I like it so much is
      because the characters are Pakistani and Muslim just like me! This really
      help me connect with the show and makes it very relatable.

    <h2>Nissan Skyline R32</h2>
    <h4>
      The R32 is one of my dream cars. I love JDM cars and this is perfect.
      Japanese cars are nice but this car takes it to the next level. It's an
      old classic but also reliable. Definently would love to have this one day!
